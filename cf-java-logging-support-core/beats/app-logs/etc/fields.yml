summary: |
  This is a specification of the "app-logs beat" message type that we use to store
  "application logs" written via a proper logging infrastructure implementation.

  NOTE: For Java applications running on CF, this is our logging support library, see
  https://github.com/SAP/cf-java-logging-support

  Field names follow the convention that we're not using camel case names, but
  rather use "_" as a delimiter between parts.

  For any field that actually represents a measure (or metric for that matter)
  the name includes a descriptive suffix mnemonic that helps identifying the unit,
  e.g.:

    * "_ms" -> milliseconds
    * "_b"  -> bytes
    * "_p"  -> percent
    * "_at" -> date with time
    * "_ts" -> timestamp

ctx:
  type: group
  description: |
    This group contains context information for the given application log message
    such that analytics can slice and dice information based on these criteria.

  fields:
    - name: "written_at"
      type: date
      required: true
      description: |
        The human-readable date when the message was written.

    - name: "written_ts"
      type: long
      required: true
      example: 1456820553816849408
      description: |
        The timestamp in nano-second precision when the message was written.

    - name: "correlation_id"
      type: string
      required: true
      example: "db2d002e-2702-41ec-66f5-c002a80a3d3f"
      description: |
        A unique identifier that can be used to correlate multiple messages into a logical unit.
        
        Currently, we use a UUID for that matter, but future versions may use
        a different key for this.

        "-" indicates that no proper value could be provided.

        NOTE: As these type of messages can be written at any time and outside
        a "request context" it may happen that this correlation id does not
        match with any other. Logging implementations may provide a way to
        inherit correlation ids from request processing layers further up in
        the processing stack. If so, that id should be used.

    - name: "request_id"
      string: string
      required: false
      example: "e24a5963-95eb-4568-b1ae-81b67c41e99a"
      description: |
        A unique identifier that can be used to correlate multiple messages to a request.

      string: string
      required: false

        A unique identifier that can be used to correlate multiple messages to a tenant.

    - name: "tenant_subdomain"
      string: string
      required: false
      example: "acme-inc"
      description: |
        A unique identifier that represents the subdomain of the current tenant specific request url, e.g. acme-inc in https://acme-inc.eu10.cloud.alm.sap/home
    
    - name: "component_id"
      type: string
      required: true
      example: "9e6f3ecf-def0-4baf-8fac-9339e61d5645"
      description: |
        A unique identifier of the software component that has written the message. 
        It may either be a "service" or an "application" that can be deployed to
        a container or VM, but it may not yet fully identify the actual "running instance" of
        that "component".

        NOTE: For applications in CF, this is the "application_id", but we may have more than one
        instance of that running.

    - name: "component_name"
      type: string
      required: false
      example: "my-fancy-component"

    - name: "component_type"
      type: string
      required: true
      example: "application"
      description: |
        The type of the software component that has written the message.

        Either "application" or "service"

    - name: "component_instance"
      type: string
      required: true
      example: "7"
      description: |
        CF allows us to scale out horizontally by running several instances of the
        same "component" in one container, this is identifying the instance.
        Defaults to "0".

    - name: "container_id"
      type: string
      required: false
      format: ???
      example: "???"
      description: |
        The unique identifier of the container on which the software component instance is running.

        NOTE: If security/privacy is not an issue, an IP address would be ok.

        NOTE: CF sets an environment variable "INSTANCE_IP" that is currently used
        for that purpose
